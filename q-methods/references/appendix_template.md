## A. [Primary Method] Configuration

[Opening paragraph describing computational platform and key dependencies at conceptual level.]

For [key component], we utilized [specific tool/model] which [brief description of what it does]. [Any relevant technical justification.]

[Parameter configuration paragraph describing key settings with rationale for choices.]

Preprocessing was conducted [describe workflow]. [Describe data organization]. [Segmentation/processing] was performed using [method], which [what it accomplishes]. The [processing] yielded the following [output description by category].

[Method] was conducted for each [unit] separately to [rationale]. Although the analytical [workflow/notebook] demonstrates processing for one [unit] at a time for [reason], each of the [N units] was analyzed following the identical workflow to ensure methodological consistency.

## B. [Secondary Method] Specifications

The [method] pipeline utilized [specific tool/model] accessed through [interface/API]. The [tool] was configured with [key parameters with rationale].

The [reliability protocol] involved [procedure description]. This approach addresses [methodological concern], as [explanation]. [Metric] serves as a quantitative reliability measure, with [threshold description].

Each [output unit] returned a structured [format] containing [fields with descriptions]. This structure ensures [benefit] and facilitates [goal].

## C. [Component] Structure

Each [component] followed a standardized structure designed to [goal]. [Describe major sections with their purposes in flowing prose.]

## D. [Categories] by [Dimension]

[For each category, provide a paragraph describing the topics/themes within that category with brief definitions in parentheses.]

## E. Complete [Component] for [Example Dimension]

The following presents the complete [component] used for [dimension] to illustrate the structure and content of [component type].

```
[Full content of the component]

## F. Limitations and Potential Remedies

[Method 1] presents several methodological limitations that warrant acknowledgment. [Describe each limitation and its mitigation in flowing prose without bullet points.]

[Method 2] also presents limitations requiring consideration. [Describe each limitation and its mitigation in flowing prose.]

Human validation recommendations include [describe recommendations in flowing prose].

## G. [Results] Summary

[PLACEHOLDER: TO BE COMPLETED. Insert summary of results after analysis is complete, including key metrics and distributions.]
