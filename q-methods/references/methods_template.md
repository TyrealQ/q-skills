## Data Collection and Preprocessing

[PLACEHOLDER: TO BE COMPLETED BY COAUTHOR. Provide description of data collection procedures including sampling strategy and participant recruitment, participant demographics, data collection protocol, timeframe, ethical considerations and IRB approval, and total sample size.]

All [recordings/responses/documents] were [transcribed/collected/processed] into text format. [PLACEHOLDER: Add information about data quality assurance procedures, anonymization protocols, corpus statistics.]

Following initial [transcription/collection], we conducted preprocessing tailored for [analysis type]. [Data units] were organized by [organizational scheme]. For each [unit], we retained [key identifiers and variables] to enable [analytical goal]. Each [unit] was then segmented at the [segmentation level], yielding a total of [N] [document type] across all [categories]. Detailed preprocessing procedures are documented in Appendix A.

## Data Analysis

Our analytical pipeline employed a [N]-stage approach combining [method 1] with [method 2] to enable [analytical goal] (Citation). This [collaborative/hybrid] approach leverages the strengths of both [strength 1] and [strength 2].

### [Analysis Stage 1 Name]

[Brief literature context justifying method selection with citations.]

In our implementation, [brief description of key methodological choices at conceptual level]. [Method] was conducted independently for each [analytical unit] to preserve [analytical goal]. Consistent with [methodological characteristic], [describe any data handling decisions]. Detailed configuration parameters are provided in Appendix A.

### [Analysis Stage 2 Name]

Building on [prior stage or literature], we implemented [method] to [goal]. We selected [specific tool/model], [brief justification with citation if applicable].

For each [analytical unit], we developed [approach description]. Each [component] contained [key elements]. Topic definitions for all [units] are summarized in Appendix D, and the complete [detailed element] is provided in Appendix E.

To assess [reliability/validity], we implemented [protocol description]. [Describe metrics and thresholds]. Technical specifications are documented in Appendix B.

### Human Validation

To ensure [validation goal], we implemented [sampling strategy] to select a subset of [data units] for independent human coding. The stratification criteria included [criteria list] to ensure representation of [target coverage].

[PLACEHOLDER: TO BE COMPLETED BY COAUTHOR. Specify sample size, coder qualifications, inter-rater reliability procedures, reconciliation process, and validation results.]

This combined approach leveraged [method 1] for [contribution 1] and [method 2] for [contribution 2], with human validation ensuring analytical rigor. The complete analytical workflow was executed using [platform] with detailed documentation provided in the appendix. Potential methodological limitations and remedies are discussed in Appendix F.
