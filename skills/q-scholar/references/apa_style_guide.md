# APA 7th Edition Style Guide for Results Sections

## Numbers

### When to Spell Out (one, two, three)
- Numbers below 10 that do not represent precise measurements
- Numbers beginning a sentence (reword if possible)
- Common fractions (one half, two thirds)
- Universally accepted usage (Twelve Apostles)

### When to Use Numerals (1, 2, 3)
- Numbers 10 and above
- Numbers below 10 when grouped with numbers 10 and above in the same paragraph
- Numbers preceding units of measurement (5 cm, 3 days)
- Statistical or mathematical functions (multiplied by 3)
- Percentages and percentiles (5%, 1st percentile)
- Ratios (5:1 ratio)
- Sample sizes, scores, and scale points
- Exact sums of money
- Numerals as numerals (the number 5)
- Times and dates
- Ages
- Points on a scale

### Examples
> The analysis identified nine categories. (below 10, not measurement)
> The study included 144,206 posts. (above 10)
> Fans contributed 46.12% of posts. (percentage)
> The sample included 5 age groups with 15 participants each. (grouped with 10+)
> Participants rated items on a scale from 1 to 7. (scale points)

## Percentages

- Always use numerals with the percent symbol: 46.12%
- In tables, use % symbol in column header, not in each cell
- Report one or two decimal places consistently
- Note when percentages do not sum to 100 due to rounding

> Fans represented 46.12% of posts.
> Agreement exceeded 90%.

## Statistical Notation

### Italicized Symbols
- M (mean)
- SD (standard deviation)
- n (sample size of subgroup)
- N (total sample size)
- p (probability)
- F (F statistic)
- t (t statistic)
- r (correlation coefficient)
- χ² (chi-square)
- df (degrees of freedom)
- α (Cronbach's alpha)
- κ (Cohen's kappa)

### Reporting Format

#### Means and Standard Deviations
> M = 27.46, SD = 12.89
> (M = 27.46, SD = 12.89)

#### Sample Sizes
> N = 144,206 (total sample)
> n = 500 (subgroup)
> (n = 66,501)

#### Percentages with Counts
> 46.12% (n = 66,501)
> Fans (46.12%, n = 66,501)

#### p Values
- Report exact values to two or three decimal places: p = .032, p = .001
- Use p < .001 for very small values (not p = .000)
- No leading zero before decimal: p = .05 (not p = 0.05)

#### Cohen's Kappa
> Cohen's κ = .82
> Inter-rater reliability yielded κ = .82, indicating substantial agreement.

#### Chi-Square
> χ²(df) = value, p = value
> χ²(3) = 12.45, p = .006

#### Effect Sizes
> d = 0.45 (Cohen's d has leading zero)
> η² = .12

## Punctuation and Formatting

### Em-Dashes
Never use em-dashes (—) in APA style. Use:
- Commas for parenthetical information
- Colons for elaboration
- Semicolons for complex lists
- Parentheses for supplementary information

### Hyphens
Use hyphens only for compound modifiers before nouns:
> high-confidence classifications
> fan-generated content
> three-way classification

Do not hyphenate:
> the classifications were high confidence
> content that is fan generated

### Commas in Numbers
Use commas in numbers 1,000 and above:
> 144,206 posts
> 1,234 participants

### Spacing Around Symbols
- No space before percent: 46%
- No space around decimal: 3.14
- Spaces around equals: M = 27.46
- Spaces around comparison operators: p < .001

## In-Text References to Tables and Figures

### First Mention
Reference tables before they appear in the document:
> Table 2 presents the distribution across conditions.
> The comparison is presented in Table 3.
> As shown in Table 4, pragmatic legitimacy dominated.

### Subsequent Mentions
> (see Table 2)
> (Table 2)

### Parenthetical References
> Fans dominated Weibo discourse (50.67%; see Table 3).

## Appendix References

> The complete codebook is provided in Appendix A.
> Detailed breakdowns are available in Appendix B.
> (see Appendix C for the full mapping)

## Common Errors to Avoid

1. Using em-dashes instead of other punctuation
2. Adding leading zeros to p values (p = 0.05)
3. Forgetting to italicize statistical symbols
4. Inconsistent decimal places
5. Bold or italic for emphasis in running text
6. Bullet points instead of prose
7. Interpreting findings in results (save for discussion)
8. Using "&" instead of "and" in running text (& only in parenthetical citations)
9. Passive voice overuse (active preferred in APA 7th)
