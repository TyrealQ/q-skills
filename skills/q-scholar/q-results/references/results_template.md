# Results Section Template

This template provides a structured approach for drafting results sections following APA 7th edition guidelines.

## Section Structure

### 1. Opening Overview

The opening paragraph orients readers to what analyses were conducted without previewing findings.

Example:
> The results are organized in four sections. First, we report the outcomes of the classification procedure. Second, we present the distribution of categories across the analytical framework. Third, we examine patterns across comparison conditions. Fourth, we report validation results.

### 2. Classification/Categorization Results

Report how data were organized into categories.

Template:
> The [classification procedure] assigned each [unit] to one of [N] categories based on [criteria]. [Confidence/reliability metric] classifications were achieved for [X]% of [units], with the remaining [Y]% receiving [lower confidence] assignments that were [retained/excluded] for [reason].

> The distribution revealed that [Category A] represented the largest contributor at [X]% of all [units] (n = [count]). [Category B] accounted for [Y]% (n = [count]), [Category C] for [Z]% (n = [count]). Together, these [N] categories comprised [total]% of the corpus.

### 3. Primary Analysis Results

Report main analytical findings organized by research question.

Template:
> [Brief statement of what was analyzed and why]. Table [N] presents the distribution.

> [Category/Condition 1] [finding statement with statistics]. This [pattern/predominance] reflects [brief factual observation without interpretation]. [Category/Condition 2] [finding statement with statistics]. [Category/Condition 3], while [smaller/larger] at [X]%, [finding statement].

### 4. Comparative Results

Report differences across conditions or groups.

Template:
> [Variable] composition differed [substantially/modestly] between [Condition A] and [Condition B], reflecting [factual observation]. Table [N] presents the comparison.

> [Condition A] [finding with percentage] (n = [count]), while [Condition B] featured [contrasting finding] (n = [count]). [Additional comparative observation with statistics].

### 5. Validation Results

Report reliability and validity metrics.

Template:
> The [classifications/assignments] were validated through independent coding of a [stratified random/random] sample of [N] [units]. Two coders independently [classified/coded] [units] according to [framework/schema] based on [criteria]. Inter-rater reliability yielded Cohen's κ = [value], indicating [substantial/almost perfect] agreement. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

### 6. Summary Paragraph

Synthesize key findings without interpretation.

Template:
> The results reveal [brief characterization of overall pattern], with [notable variation/consistency] across [conditions/contexts]. [Key finding 1 restated briefly]. [Key finding 2 restated briefly]. The complete [codebook/breakdown] including all [N] categories is provided in Appendix [X].

## Handling Different Data Types

### Frequency/Percentage Data

> [Category] represented [X]% of [total] (n = [count]).

> The distribution was [concentrated/dispersed] across categories, with [top category] ([X]%) and [second category] ([Y]%) comprising [combined]% of all [units].

### Continuous Variables

> [Variable] showed [pattern] across [conditions]. [Condition A] generated [higher/lower] values (M = [mean], SD = [sd]) compared to [Condition B] (M = [mean], SD = [sd]).

### Multi-Level Categorical Data

> Within [higher-level category], [N] subcategories emerged. [Subcategory 1] (n = [count]) represented the largest, comprising [X]% of [higher-level category] documents. [Subcategory 2] (n = [count], [Y]%) and [Subcategory 3] (n = [count], [Z]%) addressed [brief description].

## Transitional Phrases

Between sections:
- "Turning to [next topic]..."
- "[Variable] composition also varied by [condition]."
- "The distribution of [variable] varied across the four [conditions]..."
- "Beyond [previous topic], the analysis revealed..."

Introducing tables:
- "Table [N] presents the distribution."
- "Table [N] summarizes these findings."
- "The comparison is presented in Table [N]."

Referencing appendices:
- "The complete [item] is provided in Appendix [X]."
- "Detailed breakdowns are available in Appendix [X]."
