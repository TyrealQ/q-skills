description: Draft introduction sections for academic manuscripts using an interview-driven workflow. Use when the user needs to write or refine an introduction for research papers. Produces clear, flowing prose that establishes context, identifies gaps, frames research questions, previews methods, and articulates contributions. Follows a structured approach from phenomenon to theory to empirical contribution.

# Introduction Section Drafting

This skill guides drafting of introduction sections for academic manuscripts through an interview-based workflow that ensures all essential components are captured before writing.

## Core Principles

1. Write in flowing paragraphs without bullet points or em-dashes
2. Move from broad phenomenon to specific research context
3. Establish clear theoretical positioning through gap identification
4. State research questions explicitly and enumerate contributions
5. Maintain academic register appropriate for target venue
6. Include brief roadmap of article structure at conclusion

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Interview (5-8 questions)

Before drafting, conduct a structured interview covering:

**Phenomenon and Context**
- What broader phenomenon does this research address?
- What is the specific empirical context or case study?
- Why is this context particularly suitable for investigating the phenomenon?

**Theoretical Positioning**
- What disciplinary lenses have examined this phenomenon?
- What are the key theoretical frameworks being integrated or extended?
- What 2-3 substantive gaps constrain current understanding?

**Research Design**
- What research questions guide the investigation?
- What methodological approach addresses these questions?
- What is the analytical scope (sample, timeframe, variables)?

**Contributions**
- What theoretical contribution advances scholarly understanding?
- What methodological contribution enables future research?
- What empirical or practical contribution informs stakeholders?

### Phase 2: Draft Structure

An effective introduction contains six structural components:

1. **Opening Hook** (1 paragraph)
   - Establishes the broader phenomenon
   - Situates within contemporary context
   - Signals relevance and timeliness

2. **Literature Positioning** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Reviews prior scholarship from relevant disciplines
   - Identifies complementary perspectives
   - Articulates 2-3 substantive gaps

3. **Research Context** (1 paragraph)
   - Introduces the specific case or empirical setting
   - Justifies case selection
   - Previews analytical scope

4. **Research Questions** (1 paragraph)
   - States RQs explicitly (numbered or embedded in prose)
   - Briefly previews methodological approach
   - Links questions to gaps identified

5. **Contributions Statement** (1 paragraph)
   - Enumerates theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions
   - Uses parallel structure for clarity
   - Signals broader applicability beyond immediate context

6. **Article Roadmap** (1 paragraph)
   - Briefly outlines remaining sections
   - Provides reader orientation
   - Transitions to literature review

### Phase 3: Writing Style

**Tone and Register**
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Avoid hedging language when making clear claims
- Write accessibly without sacrificing precision

**Sentence Structure**
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Use hyphens for compound modifiers
- Never use em-dashes; use commas or semicolons
- Spell out numbers below ten unless measurements or statistics

**Citations**
- Integrate citations smoothly into prose
- Group related citations parenthetically
- Use "Citation (year)" for author-focused references
- Use "(Citation)" for supporting references

**Gap Articulation**
Frame gaps constructively rather than critically:
- "Despite these advances, three substantive gaps constrain..."
- "Limited attention has been given to..."
- "The role of X remains underdeveloped..."

**Contribution Framing**
Use parallel structure:
- "Theoretically, this study advances..."
- "Methodologically, the study introduces..."
- "Empirically, the findings yield..."

## Template Patterns

### Opening Hook Pattern

```
The [phenomenon] has fundamentally transformed how [domain activity] is
[produced/distributed/consumed]. Traditional [prior approach], once the
dominant [channel/method], is increasingly [supplemented/supplanted] by
[new approach] where [key mechanism] drives [outcome] (Citation). This
shift toward [trend] carries particular significance for [specific context],
which must [key challenge] through [means] rather than [traditional approach].
```

### Gap Articulation Pattern

```
Prior scholarship has examined [phenomenon] through complementary disciplinary
lenses. [Discipline 1] research has investigated [focus], while [discipline 2]
literatures have emphasized [focus] (Citations). [Additional literature stream]
further demonstrates [finding] (Citations). Despite these advances, [N]
substantive gaps constrain theoretical and practical understanding. First,
[gap 1 with explanation]. Second, [gap 2 with explanation]. Third, [gap 3
with explanation].
```

### Research Question Pattern

```
[N] research questions guide the investigation: (RQ1) [question]? (RQ2)
[question]? (RQ3) [question]? (RQ4) [question]? The analytical approach
employs [brief method description] to systematically [analytical goal].
[Outcome variable] is operationalized through [measurement approach],
complemented by [additional measures].
```

### Contributions Pattern

```
This research offers [N] contributions. Theoretically, the study advances
[framework/understanding], demonstrating how [integration/extension] can
explain [phenomenon] beyond the immediate empirical context. Methodologically,
the study introduces [approach/pipeline] that can be adapted to [broader
applications], addressing calls for [methodological need]. Empirically, the
findings yield actionable insights for [stakeholders], clarifying [practical
implications].
```

## Scope Boundaries

**Include in introduction:**
- Broad phenomenon contextualization
- Prior literature streams and gaps
- Research questions and brief method preview
- Contribution statements
- Article roadmap

**Reserve for other sections:**
- Detailed literature review and hypothesis development
- Comprehensive methodology description
- Results and findings
- Extended discussion and implications

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Opening establishes phenomenon before introducing specific context
- [ ] Literature review spans relevant disciplinary perspectives
- [ ] Gaps are clearly articulated (typically 2-4)
- [ ] Research questions directly address identified gaps
- [ ] Case selection is justified
- [ ] Contributions are enumerated with parallel structure
- [ ] Roadmap previews remaining sections
- [ ] No bullet points or em-dashes in prose
- [ ] Citations integrated smoothly
- [ ] Appropriate length for venue (typically 3-5 paragraphs)
