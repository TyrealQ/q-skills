# Introduction Section Drafting

This skill guides drafting and refinement of introduction sections for academic manuscripts. It supports two modes: an interview-based workflow for drafting from scratch, and a diagnostic workflow for refining existing drafts.

## Core Principles

1. Write in flowing paragraphs without bullet points or em-dashes
2. Move from broad phenomenon to specific research context
3. Trace a single narrative arc through the literature rather than cataloging disconnected streams
4. Ground the literature review in the target journal's home discipline first; let adjacent fields enter as natural extensions
5. Introduce theoretical frameworks as the resolution to a question or need established in the preceding paragraph, never abruptly
6. Bridge every paragraph transition explicitly: each opening must resolve or extend the prior paragraph's conclusion
7. Design research questions with a clear scope progression (e.g., descriptive, relational, conditional)
8. Choose key variable terms deliberately to capture the full dimensionality of what is being studied
9. State research questions explicitly and enumerate contributions with parallel structure
10. Maintain academic register appropriate for target venue
11. Include brief roadmap of article structure at conclusion

## Argumentative Architecture

This section codifies the logic that connects paragraphs into a cohesive argument. Structure and templates (below) describe what goes where; argumentative architecture describes why each element appears where it does and how it connects to its neighbors.

### Paragraph-Level Architecture

**P1 (Phenomenon and Stakes):** Establish the broader trend transforming the domain. Signal the specific context where the trend is most consequential. End with the stakes: what is at risk, what is unknown, or what opportunity the trend creates. The final sentence should implicitly raise a question that the next paragraph will address.

**P2 (Literature and Gaps):** Begin from the target discipline's core research traditions, not from adjacent or tangential fields. Progress outward: as the discipline's own tools and frameworks prove insufficient for the reframed question, introduce adjacent literatures as natural extensions. Reframe the central question that the field now faces. Then let gaps emerge as inevitable consequences of the narrative trajectory, not as disconnected items in a list. Each gap should flow from the preceding narrative.

**P3 (Theory, Study, and Research Questions):** Open with a bridge sentence that directly resolves P2's gaps (e.g., "Addressing these gaps requires a theoretical lens that..."). Introduce the primary theoretical framework as the answer to P2's reframed question, explaining why it is suited to the task. If using a complementary framework, explain what evaluative or perceptual dimension it captures that the primary framework alone cannot. Then describe the empirical context and justify its selection. State research questions in progressive scope, followed by a brief methods preview.

**P4 (Contributions):** Enumerate theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions using parallel structure. Each contribution should signal applicability beyond the immediate context.

**P5 (Roadmap):** Brief orientation to the remaining sections. Transition to the literature review.

### Cross-Paragraph Bridge Patterns

Bridges are the connective tissue of the argument. Each paragraph's opening sentence must explicitly connect to the prior paragraph's conclusion:

- P1 to P2: P1 ends with stakes or an implicit question; P2 opens by grounding in the discipline's response to those stakes (e.g., "The field has extensively examined...")
- P2 to P3: P2 ends with gaps that constrain understanding; P3 opens by stating what is needed to address them (e.g., "Addressing these gaps requires a generalizable lens capable of...")
- P3 to P4: P3 ends with methods preview; P4 opens with contributions enumeration (e.g., "This research offers three contributions")
- P4 to P5: P4 ends with the final contribution; P5 opens with the roadmap (e.g., "The article is organized as follows")

### Within-Paragraph Logic

**Literature paragraph:** Each literature stream should enter because the previous stream raised a question it cannot answer. Do not list streams as "complementary" without showing the intellectual connection. The paragraph should read as a single progressive narrative, not a catalog of fields.

**Gap identification:** Gaps should feel like inevitable consequences of the trajectory, not items appended to a list. Ask: given everything we just traced, what naturally remains unresolved? The answer yields the gaps.

**Theory paragraph:** The theoretical framework should be introduced as the resolution to a problem, not as background information. The reader should feel that the framework is the logical answer to the question the literature paragraph raised.

**Research questions:** Design RQs with a clear scope progression. A common pattern:
- RQ1 (descriptive): What is the landscape? How are key features distributed?
- RQ2 (relational): How do key variables relate to outcomes?
- RQ3 (conditional): Under which specific conditions are effects strongest?

Each RQ should reflect the study's key variables. If a concept encompasses multiple dimensions (e.g., channel size, content genre, video format), the umbrella term used in the RQs should capture that full dimensionality.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Interview (5-8 questions)

Before drafting, conduct a structured interview covering:

**Target Venue and Disciplinary Home** (ask first)
- What journal or venue are you targeting?
- What is the home discipline of this journal?
- What are the core concerns and established research traditions of this discipline?
- How should the literature review be anchored in this discipline before extending to adjacent fields?
- What is the typical introduction length and style for this venue?

**Phenomenon and Context**
- What broader phenomenon does this research address?
- What is the specific empirical context or case study?
- Why is this context particularly suitable for investigating the phenomenon?

**Theoretical Positioning**
- What are the key theoretical frameworks being used?
- What makes each framework appropriate given the gaps in existing scholarship?
- If using multiple theories, what does the integration enable that single theories cannot?
- What 2-3 substantive gaps constrain current understanding?

**Research Design**
- What research questions guide the investigation?
- How do these questions map to the gaps identified?
- Do the questions follow a scope progression (descriptive, relational, conditional)?
- What methodological approach addresses these questions?
- What is the analytical scope (sample, timeframe, variables)?

**Contributions**
- What theoretical contribution advances scholarly understanding?
- What methodological contribution enables future research?
- What empirical or practical contribution informs stakeholders?

### Phase 2: Draft Structure

An effective introduction contains five structural components, each with a specific argumentative role:

1. **Opening Hook** (1 paragraph)
   - Establishes the broader phenomenon
   - Situates within contemporary context
   - Ends with stakes that implicitly raise a question for the next paragraph

2. **Literature and Gaps** (1 paragraph)
   - Begins from the target discipline's core concerns
   - Progresses outward as existing frameworks prove insufficient
   - Reframes the central question
   - Lets gaps emerge as natural consequences of the trajectory

3. **Theory, Context, and Research Questions** (1 paragraph)
   - Opens with a bridge resolving the gaps
   - Introduces theory as the answer, not background
   - Describes the empirical context and justifies its selection
   - States RQs in progressive scope with brief methods preview

4. **Contributions Statement** (1 paragraph)
   - Enumerates theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions
   - Uses parallel structure for clarity
   - Signals broader applicability beyond immediate context

5. **Article Roadmap** (1 paragraph)
   - Briefly outlines remaining sections
   - Provides reader orientation
   - Transitions to literature review

### Phase 3: Writing and Tightening

**Tone and Register**
- Use active voice where appropriate
- Avoid hedging language when making clear claims
- Write accessibly without sacrificing precision

**Sentence Structure**
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Use hyphens for compound modifiers only
- Never use em-dashes; use commas, semicolons, or parentheses
- Spell out numbers below ten unless measurements or statistics
- Cut filler phrases (e.g., "has devoted sustained attention to" can become "has extensively examined")
- Compress clause chains: reduce multi-clause compound sentences to direct constructions
- Favor direct subject-verb openings over passive or wordy constructions
- If two sentences make the same point, merge or cut one
- Every sentence must earn its place; if removing it does not weaken the argument, remove it

**Citations**
- Integrate citations smoothly into prose
- Group related citations parenthetically
- Use "Citation (year)" for author-focused references
- Use "(Citation)" for supporting references

**Gap Articulation**
Frame gaps constructively rather than critically:
- "Three gaps emerge from this trajectory..."
- "Limited attention has been given to..."
- "The role of X remains underdeveloped..."

Anti-pattern: Listing disconnected literature streams as "complementary" without showing how they connect. Instead, trace a progression where each stream enters because the previous one raised a question it cannot answer.

**Contribution Framing**
Use parallel structure:
- "Theoretically, this study advances..."
- "Methodologically, the study introduces..."
- "Empirically, the findings yield..."

### Phase 4: Refinement Mode

When the user has an existing draft rather than starting from scratch, use this diagnostic workflow instead of or after the interview.

**Step 1: Read and Diagnose**

Read the full introduction and evaluate against the diagnostic checklist:
- [ ] Does the literature paragraph trace a single narrative arc, or does it catalog disconnected streams?
- [ ] Does the theory appear motivated by a question or need from the preceding paragraph, or does it come from nowhere?
- [ ] Do paragraph transitions bridge explicitly, or do they jump?
- [ ] Do RQs follow a scope progression (descriptive, relational, conditional), or are they a flat list?
- [ ] Are key variable terms precise enough to capture their full dimensionality?
- [ ] Is there redundancy (two sentences making the same point)?
- [ ] Does the literature review start from the target discipline's core concerns?

**Step 2: Restructure (Macro)**

Address paragraph-level architecture first:
- Reorder or merge paragraphs so the argument follows the P1-P2-P3-P4-P5 progression
- Ensure each paragraph has a clear argumentative role
- Relocate material that belongs in other sections (detailed theory to literature review, methods detail to methods section)

**Step 3: Revise (Meso)**

Address within-paragraph logic:
- Restructure the literature paragraph into a single narrative arc
- Ensure gaps emerge from the trajectory rather than appearing as a disconnected list
- Motivate the theoretical framework as a resolution to the preceding gaps
- Revise RQs for scope progression and variable precision

**Step 4: Tighten (Micro)**

Address sentence-level prose:
- Cut filler phrases and compress clause chains
- Eliminate redundant sentences
- Verify cross-paragraph bridges
- Ensure every sentence earns its place

## Template Patterns

### Opening Hook Pattern

```
The [phenomenon] has fundamentally transformed how [domain activity] is
[produced/distributed/consumed]. Traditional [prior approach], once the
dominant [channel/method], is increasingly [supplemented/supplanted] by
[new approach] where [key mechanism] drives [outcome] (Citation). This
shift toward [trend] carries particular significance for [specific context],
which must [key challenge] through [means] rather than [traditional approach].
```

### Literature and Gaps Pattern

Architecture note: Begin from the target discipline's core research tradition. Each subsequent stream should enter because the previous one raised a question it cannot answer. End with gaps that feel like inevitable consequences.

```
[Target discipline] scholarship has extensively examined [core question].
[Core research stream] developed [frameworks/scales] for [traditional context]
(Citations), later extended to [newer context] (Citations). As [domain shift]
has migrated to [new environment], scholars recognize that [new dynamics]
restructure [activity] itself (Citations), and [content/platform features]
actively shape [outcomes] (Citations). This reframes a central question:
beyond [what prior work asked], how do [observable properties] [activate/
shape] [deeper mechanisms]? Yet the field's predominant methodology,
[dominant approach] (Citations), is ill-equipped to answer it. [N] gaps
emerge. First, [gap 1]. Second, [gap 2]. Third, [gap 3].
```

### Theory and Research Questions Pattern

Architecture note: Open with a bridge that resolves the gaps. Introduce theory as the answer to the reframed question, not as background.

```
Addressing these gaps requires a generalizable [theoretical lens/framework]
capable of [linking X to Y]. [Theory Name] offers this lens, identifying
[core constructs] whose [mechanism] fosters [outcomes] (Citations). Applied
to [domain], [Theory] shifts the question from [old question] to [new
question], providing a principled basis for [analytical contribution]. To
capture [complementary dimension], the study pairs [Theory 1] with [Theory 2],
which [complementary mechanism] (Citations). This combined framework is
applied to [empirical context], a [brief characterization]. [Context] [key
features], providing a particularly instructive setting for [investigation
focus]. Analyzing [N units] [data type], [N] research questions guide the
investigation: (RQ1) [descriptive question]? (RQ2) [relational question]?
(RQ3) [conditional question]? [Brief methods sentence describing analytical
pipeline and measurement approach].
```

### Contributions Pattern

```
This research offers [N] contributions. Theoretically, the study advances
[framework/understanding], demonstrating how [integration/extension] can
explain [phenomenon] beyond the immediate empirical context. Methodologically,
the study introduces [approach/pipeline] that can be adapted to [broader
applications], addressing calls for [methodological need]. Empirically, the
findings yield actionable insights for [stakeholders], clarifying [practical
implications].
```
