# Introduction Interview Protocol

Use these questions to gather the information needed to draft an effective introduction. Adapt questions based on the research context and user's existing materials.

## 1. Phenomenon and Context

### 1.1 Broader Phenomenon
- What larger trend or transformation does your research address?
- How has this phenomenon changed the field/industry/domain?
- Why is this phenomenon significant now (timeliness)?

### 1.2 Empirical Context
- What specific case, setting, or context are you studying?
- What makes this context particularly suitable for investigating the phenomenon?
- What unique characteristics does this context have?

### 1.3 Temporal Scope
- What time period does your study cover?
- Are there critical events or milestones within this period?
- Is there a pre/post dynamic (e.g., pre-launch, pre-intervention)?

## 2. Literature and Theory

### 2.1 Disciplinary Perspectives
- What academic disciplines have examined this phenomenon?
- What are the key theoretical frameworks from each discipline?
- How do these perspectives complement each other?

### 2.2 Primary Theoretical Framework
- What is the main theory guiding your research?
- What are its core constructs or mechanisms?
- How does it explain the phenomenon you're studying?

### 2.3 Secondary/Complementary Theory
- Are you integrating multiple theoretical perspectives?
- How do the theories connect or complement each other?
- What does the integration enable that single theories cannot?

### 2.4 Gap Identification
- What does existing research NOT adequately address?
- Why is this gap important to fill?
- How does your research address this gap?

Probe for 2-4 distinct gaps:
- Theoretical gaps (frameworks not integrated, mechanisms unexplained)
- Contextual gaps (understudied settings, populations, time periods)
- Methodological gaps (measurement limitations, analytical approaches)
- Practical gaps (stakeholder needs not addressed)

## 3. Research Design

### 3.1 Research Questions
- What specific questions does your research answer?
- How do these questions map to the gaps you identified?
- Are questions descriptive, relational, or causal?

### 3.2 Methodological Approach
- What type of study is this (qualitative, quantitative, mixed)?
- What analytical methods do you employ?
- What makes this approach suitable for your questions?

### 3.3 Data and Sample
- What data did you collect or analyze?
- What is the scope (N, time range, sources)?
- How were data collected or sampled?

### 3.4 Key Variables
- What are your main independent variables or predictors?
- What are your dependent variables or outcomes?
- What moderators or control variables are relevant?

## 4. Contributions

### 4.1 Theoretical Contribution
- How does this research advance theory?
- What new understanding does it provide?
- How generalizable is this contribution beyond your specific context?

### 4.2 Methodological Contribution
- Does your research introduce new methods, measures, or analytical approaches?
- Can these be adapted for other research contexts?
- What methodological limitations does this address?

### 4.3 Empirical/Practical Contribution
- What actionable insights emerge for practitioners?
- Who are the stakeholders who benefit from these findings?
- What specific decisions or strategies do findings inform?

## 5. Target Venue

### 5.1 Publication Outlet
- What journal or venue are you targeting?
- What is the typical introduction length for this venue?
- What disciplinary audience will read this?

### 5.2 Positioning
- How does this paper position relative to the venue's scope?
- What theoretical or methodological orientation does the venue favor?
- Are there recent papers in this venue that serve as models?

## Adapting the Interview

**For theory-driven papers:** Spend more time on theoretical frameworks and gap articulation.

**For empirical/applied papers:** Focus on context description and practical contributions.

**For methodological papers:** Emphasize the method preview and methodological contribution.

**For papers with existing drafts:** Use the interview to identify missing elements rather than starting from scratch.
