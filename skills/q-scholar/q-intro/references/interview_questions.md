# Introduction Interview Protocol

Use these questions to gather the information needed to draft an effective introduction. Adapt questions based on the research context and user's existing materials.

**Important:** Begin with target venue questions. Knowing the disciplinary home anchors all subsequent decisions about literature grounding, theoretical positioning, and writing register.

## 1. Target Venue and Disciplinary Home

### 1.1 Publication Outlet
- What journal or venue are you targeting?
- What is the typical introduction length for this venue?
- What disciplinary audience will read this?

### 1.2 Disciplinary Grounding
- What is the home discipline of this journal?
- What are the core concerns and established research traditions of this discipline?
- How should the literature review be anchored in this discipline before extending to adjacent fields?
- What theoretical or methodological orientation does the venue favor?

### 1.3 Positioning
- How does this paper position relative to the venue's scope?
- Are there recent papers in this venue that serve as models?

## 2. Phenomenon and Context

### 2.1 Broader Phenomenon
- What larger trend or transformation does your research address?
- How has this phenomenon changed the field, industry, or domain?
- Why is this phenomenon significant now (timeliness)?

### 2.2 Empirical Context
- What specific case, setting, or context are you studying?
- What makes this context particularly suitable for investigating the phenomenon?
- What unique characteristics does this context have?

### 2.3 Temporal Scope
- What time period does your study cover?
- Are there critical events or milestones within this period?
- Is there a pre/post dynamic (e.g., pre-launch, pre-intervention)?

## 3. Literature and Theory

### 3.1 Disciplinary Core
- What research tradition within the target discipline is most relevant?
- What are the foundational studies and frameworks in this tradition?
- Where has this tradition reached its limits, raising questions it cannot answer?

### 3.2 Adjacent Literatures
- What adjacent fields or literatures become relevant as the core tradition proves insufficient?
- How do these adjacent perspectives enter naturally as extensions, not disconnected streams?
- What does each adjacent stream contribute that the core tradition lacks?

### 3.3 Primary Theoretical Framework
- What is the main theory guiding your research?
- What are its core constructs or mechanisms?
- Why is this theory the appropriate response to the gaps identified?
- How does it reframe the central question from what the literature traditionally asked?

### 3.4 Secondary/Complementary Theory
- Are you integrating multiple theoretical perspectives?
- What evaluative, perceptual, or explanatory dimension does the complementary theory capture that the primary theory alone cannot?
- How do the theories connect?

### 3.5 Gap Identification
- What does existing research NOT adequately address?
- Do the gaps emerge naturally from the narrative trajectory, or are they disconnected from the literature reviewed?
- How does your research address each gap?

Probe for 2-4 distinct gaps:
- Theoretical gaps (frameworks not integrated, mechanisms unexplained)
- Contextual gaps (understudied settings, populations, time periods)
- Methodological gaps (measurement limitations, analytical approaches)
- Practical gaps (stakeholder needs not addressed)

## 4. Research Design

### 4.1 Research Questions
- What specific questions does your research answer?
- How do these questions map to the gaps you identified?
- Do the questions follow a scope progression?
  - Descriptive: What is the landscape?
  - Relational: How do variables relate to outcomes?
  - Conditional: Under which conditions are effects strongest?

### 4.2 Key Variables and Concepts
- What are your main independent variables or predictors?
- What are your dependent variables or outcomes?
- What moderators or contextual conditions are relevant?
- Do your umbrella terms for key variables capture their full dimensionality? (e.g., if a concept encompasses multiple dimensions such as size, type, and format, does the term reflect that breadth?)

### 4.3 Methodological Approach
- What type of study is this (qualitative, quantitative, mixed)?
- What analytical methods do you employ?
- What makes this approach suitable for your questions?

### 4.4 Data and Sample
- What data did you collect or analyze?
- What is the scope (N, time range, sources)?
- How were data collected or sampled?

## 5. Contributions

### 5.1 Theoretical Contribution
- How does this research advance theory?
- What new understanding does it provide?
- How generalizable is this contribution beyond your specific context?

### 5.2 Methodological Contribution
- Does your research introduce new methods, measures, or analytical approaches?
- Can these be adapted for other research contexts?
- What methodological limitations does this address?

### 5.3 Empirical/Practical Contribution
- What actionable insights emerge for practitioners?
- Who are the stakeholders who benefit from these findings?
- What specific decisions or strategies do findings inform?

Methodological: [Contribution]
Empirical: [Contribution]
```

## Adapting the Interview

**For theory-driven papers:** Spend more time on theoretical frameworks, gap articulation, and the narrative arc from core discipline to adjacent fields.

**For empirical/applied papers:** Focus on context description, practical contributions, and variable dimensionality.

**For methodological papers:** Emphasize the method preview and methodological contribution.

**For papers with existing drafts:** Use the refinement diagnostic (Phase 4 in SKILL.md) instead of or alongside the interview to identify missing elements and structural issues.

## Refinement Diagnostic

When the user has an existing draft, use these questions to identify structural issues before revising:

**Narrative Architecture**
- Does P1 end with stakes that P2 picks up?
- Does P2 begin from the target discipline's core concerns, or from an adjacent field?
- Does each literature stream enter because the previous one raised a question it cannot answer, or are they listed as disconnected items?
- Do the gaps emerge as natural consequences of the trajectory, or do they feel appended?

**Theory Introduction**
- Does the theory appear motivated by P2's gaps, or does it come from nowhere?
- Is there a clear bridge sentence connecting P2's conclusion to P3's opening?
- If using a complementary theory, is its added value explained?

**Research Questions**
- Do the RQs follow a scope progression (descriptive, relational, conditional)?
- Do the RQs reflect the study's key variables with appropriately precise terminology?
- Does each RQ map to at least one identified gap?

**Prose Quality**
- Are there redundant sentences (two sentences making the same point)?
- Are there filler phrases that can be compressed?
- Do cross-paragraph transitions bridge explicitly?
