# Introduction Section Template

This template provides fill-in-the-blank patterns for each structural component. Each section includes an architectural annotation explaining the logic behind the pattern, not just the structure.

## Opening Hook

**Architecture:** Establish the broader phenomenon and its significance. End with stakes that implicitly raise a question the next paragraph will address. The final sentence should create forward momentum toward the literature paragraph.

The [PHENOMENON] has fundamentally transformed how [DOMAIN ACTIVITY] is [PRODUCED/DISTRIBUTED/CONSUMED]. Traditional [PRIOR APPROACH], once the dominant [CHANNEL/METHOD] for [DOMAIN], are increasingly [SUPPLEMENTED/SUPPLANTED] by [NEW APPROACH] where [KEY MECHANISM] drives [OUTCOME] (Citation). [PLATFORM/TECHNOLOGY] have emerged as [ROLE], functioning as [FUNCTION 1], [FUNCTION 2], and [FUNCTION 3] (Citation). This shift carries particular significance for [SPECIFIC CONTEXT], which must [KEY CHALLENGE] through [MEANS] rather than [TRADITIONAL APPROACH]. [ACTORS] varying in [DIMENSION 1], [DIMENSION 2], and [DIMENSION 3] [PRODUCE/CREATE] [OUTPUTS] that [MEDIATE/SHAPE] how [AUDIENCES] perceive [OFFERINGS] (Citation). For [CONTEXT DESCRIPTOR], the [TIME PERIOD] represents a critical window during which [EARLY ACTIVITY] establishes [FRAMEWORKS] and conditions [OUTCOMES] before [AUDIENCES] can directly experience [OFFERING].

## Literature and Gaps

**Architecture:** Begin from the target discipline's core research tradition. Each subsequent literature stream should enter because the previous one raised a question it cannot answer. Reframe the central question that the field now faces. Let gaps emerge as inevitable consequences of the narrative trajectory, not as disconnected items. The paragraph should read as a single progressive narrative, not a catalog of fields.

[TARGET DISCIPLINE] scholarship has extensively examined [CORE QUESTION]. [CORE RESEARCH STREAM] developed [FRAMEWORKS/SCALES] for [TRADITIONAL CONTEXT] (Citations), later extended to [NEWER CONTEXT] (Citations), while [RELATED STREAM] linked [MECHANISM] to [OUTCOME] (Citations). As [DOMAIN SHIFT] has migrated to [NEW ENVIRONMENT], scholars recognize that [NEW DYNAMICS] restructure [ACTIVITY] itself: [PLATFORMS/SYSTEMS] mediate how [AUDIENCES] [DISCOVER/EVALUATE] [OFFERINGS] (Citations), and [CONTENT/PLATFORM FEATURES] actively shape [BEHAVIOR] and [INTERPRETATION] (Citations). This reframes a central question: beyond [WHAT PRIOR WORK ASKED], how do [OBSERVABLE PROPERTIES] [ACTIVATE/SHAPE] [DEEPER MECHANISMS] and [TRANSLATE INTO] [AUDIENCE RESPONSES]? Yet the field's predominant methodology, [DOMINANT APPROACH] within [ESTABLISHED SETTINGS] (Citations), is ill-equipped to answer it. [N] gaps emerge. First, [GAP 1: e.g., existing frameworks limit generalizability and do not illuminate how FEATURES activate MECHANISMS]. Second, [GAP 2: e.g., the focus on ESTABLISHED CONTEXTS leaves UNDERSTUDIED CONTEXTS unaddressed, yet AUDIENCES must JUDGE OFFERINGS in this period] (Citation). Third, [GAP 3: e.g., while ADJACENT SCHOLARSHIP has advanced in CONSUMER SETTINGS, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC APPLICATION remains underdeveloped, particularly regarding how KEY VARIABLE DIMENSIONS shape PERCEPTIONS] (Citations).

## Theory, Context, and Research Questions

**Architecture:** Open with a bridge sentence that directly resolves the gaps from the literature paragraph. Introduce the primary theoretical framework as the answer to the reframed question, explaining why it is suited to the task. If using a complementary framework, explain what dimension it captures that the primary framework alone cannot. Then describe the empirical context and justify its selection. State research questions in progressive scope (descriptive, relational, conditional), followed by a brief methods preview.

Addressing these gaps requires a generalizable [THEORETICAL LENS/FRAMEWORK] capable of [LINKING X TO Y]. [THEORY NAME] offers this lens, identifying [CORE CONSTRUCTS] whose [MECHANISM] fosters [OUTCOMES] (Citations). Applied to [DOMAIN], [THEORY] shifts the question from [OLD QUESTION] to [NEW QUESTION], providing a principled basis for connecting [CONTENT PROPERTIES] to [AUDIENCE RESPONSES]. To capture [COMPLEMENTARY DIMENSION], the study pairs [THEORY 1] with [THEORY 2], which [ORGANIZES/CAPTURES] [PERCEPTUAL/EVALUATIVE DIMENSION] (Citations). This combined framework is applied to [EMPIRICAL CONTEXT], a [BRIEF CHARACTERIZATION] that [KEY EVENT/TIMEFRAME]. [CONTEXT] [KEY FEATURE 1] and [KEY FEATURE 2], relying on [MECHANISM] for [DEVELOPMENT/ENGAGEMENT]. Analyzing [N UNITS] [DATA TYPE] [COLLECTION SCOPE], [N] research questions guide the investigation: (RQ1) How are [KEY FEATURES] distributed across [DATA SCOPE], and how do they vary by [KEY VARIABLE]? (RQ2) How do [KEY FEATURES] and [KEY VARIABLE] relate to [OUTCOME MEASURES]? (RQ3) Under which specific [KEY VARIABLE CONDITIONS] do [KEY FEATURES] most strongly predict [OUTCOMES]? [BRIEF METHODS SENTENCE: analytical pipeline and measurement approach] (Citation if applicable).

## Contributions Statement

**Architecture:** Enumerate contributions using parallel structure. Each contribution should signal applicability beyond the immediate context.

This research offers [N] contributions. Theoretically, the study [ADVANCES/PROPOSES] [FRAMEWORK/UNDERSTANDING], [DEMONSTRATING/ARTICULATING] how [INTEGRATION/EXTENSION] can [EXPLAIN/PREDICT] [PHENOMENON], providing a [CONCEPTUAL VOCABULARY/FRAMEWORK] applicable to [BROADER CONTEXT] beyond the immediate setting. Methodologically, the study introduces [APPROACH/PIPELINE] that [RESPONDS TO/ADDRESSES] calls for [METHODOLOGICAL NEED] (Citation if applicable). Empirically, the findings [PRODUCE/YIELD] [EVIDENCE-BASED INSIGHTS] for [STAKEHOLDER LIST], [CLARIFYING/OFFERING] [PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS].

## Article Roadmap

**Architecture:** Brief orientation. Each sentence maps to one section of the article.

The article is organized as follows. The next section reviews relevant literature on [LITERATURE TOPIC 1], [LITERATURE TOPIC 2], and [LITERATURE TOPIC 3]. The methods section details [METHOD COMPONENT 1], [METHOD COMPONENT 2], [METHOD COMPONENT 3], and [METHOD COMPONENT 4]. Results present [RESULTS COMPONENT 1], [RESULTS COMPONENT 2], and [RESULTS COMPONENT 3]. The discussion interprets findings, articulates [THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL] implications, and proposes directions for future research.
