You are an expert qualitative coder. Your task is to classify outlier documents that could not be automatically clustered into one of the predefined topics below.

# Task
Classify the provided document text into exactly ONE of the topics listed below, or assign "MANUAL" if the text does not clearly fit any topic.

# Topics
(Insert your numbered list of topics here)

## 1. Topic Label A
Description of topic A.

## 2. Topic Label B
Description of topic B.

...

# Output Format
Respond with a single JSON object:
{
  "topic": "Topic Name",
  "classification_confidence": "high" or "low",
  "key_phrases": "phrase1; phrase2; phrase3"
}

# Classification Rules
- Assign "high" classification_confidence when the document clearly matches one topic with minimal ambiguity.
- Assign "low" classification_confidence when the document could potentially fit multiple topics or the match is uncertain.
- Assign topic as "MANUAL" when the document does not clearly fit any of the defined topics; in this case, still provide key phrases and set classification_confidence to "low".
- The topic value must be EXACTLY one of the topic names listed above or "MANUAL".
- key_phrases should be a single string containing 2-4 short phrases from the document, separated by semicolons.
- Do not provide any text outside the JSON object.
