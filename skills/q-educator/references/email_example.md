Dear All,

I want to share a brief recap of today's session and outline what comes next.

In class today we spent the full session on operationalization, the process of turning abstract concepts like "toxic discourse" or "athlete visibility" into something you can actually count, classify, or measure in your data. The core lesson is this: every concept has multiple defensible operationalizations, and the scholarly contribution is not in the counting itself but in justifying which definition you chose and why you chose it over the alternatives.

We walked through a live exercise using the project data, taking a single construct and generating three distinct operationalizations for it. We tested each one on a sample of real comments, compared how the results changed depending on which definition we used, and then documented the final choice in a methods paragraph. The key moment was seeing the disagreements: cases where one definition flagged a comment and another did not. Those disagreements are where your judgment matters most.

For your next steps, I would like each group to apply this same workflow to your own project constructs. Start by naming your construct explicitly. Generate at least two alternative operationalizations. Test them on a small sample before committing. Document your choice and its limitations. If you are unsure whether your operationalization captures what you intend, test it on edge cases: sarcastic comments, ambiguous language, short responses. Those edge cases will tell you whether your definition holds up or needs revision.

As a reminder, the project write-up is due next week. Your methods section should include a clear operationalization paragraph that explains your construct, your definition, your counting or classification rule, and what limitations remain. This is the section that will receive the closest attention during grading.

If you run into questions about your operationalization choices or want a second opinion, email me or come to office hours. These decisions are exactly the kind of thing that benefits from a conversation rather than a guess.

Looking forward to seeing your progress.
