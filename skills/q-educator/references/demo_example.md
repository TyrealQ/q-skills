## Overview

| Segment                 | Time    | What Students See                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Demo (instructor-led)   | ~45 min | Operationalization workflow: concept, define, test, compare, revise |
| Student Experimentation | ~30 min | Applying the workflow to their own project constructs               |

**Dataset:** Current project data
**Tool:** AI coding assistant

## Step 1: Naming the Construct (~5 min)

### What to Say

> "Before we touch the data, we name what we are trying to measure. Not vaguely. Precisely. I am going to take the concept of 'skill-based discourse' and turn it into something countable."

### What to Show

1. Open the AI coding tool
2. Enter plan mode:
   > "I want to operationalize the construct 'skill-based discourse' in social media comments about athletes. Help me define three distinct operationalizations, each with a clear counting rule and at least one limitation."
3. Walk through the three options generated

### Key Teaching Moment

> "Notice the AI gave me three options, not one. That is intentional. In a real scouting session, you do not just watch one angle of film. You look at the play from the end zone camera, the sideline camera, and the all-22. Each angle reveals something the others miss. Same principle here: each operationalization captures a different facet of the construct."

### Quick Check (~1 min)
- "Which of the three options feels most defensible for your project? Why?"

---

## Step 2: Testing on a Sample (~10 min)

### What to Show

1. Select 20 comments from the dataset
2. Ask the tool to classify them using each of the three operationalizations:
   > "Apply each of these three definitions to the following 20 comments. For each comment, indicate which definitions it matches and which it does not. Show me the disagreements."
3. Walk through the disagreements: cases where one definition flags a comment and another does not

### Key Teaching Moment

> "This is the equivalent of running practice reps before the game. You test your scheme against real plays to see where it breaks down. If your operationalization flags sarcastic praise as genuine skill discourse, you know the definition needs work before you run it on 10,000 comments."

---

## Step 3: Comparing Results (~10 min)

### What to Show

1. Run all three operationalizations on a larger sample (200 comments)
2. Compare the results:
   > "Show me how the proportion of skill-based comments changes depending on which operationalization I use. Display the three results side by side."
3. Discuss: which definition produces the highest count? The lowest? What does the gap tell us?

### Key Teaching Moment

> "The spread between these three numbers is your uncertainty band. If all three definitions give you roughly the same result, you can be more confident. If they diverge, you need to justify your choice. That justification is the scholarly contribution. The counting is just the mechanism."

### Quick Check (~1 min)
- "If you saw a 15-percentage-point difference between two operationalizations, what would you do next?"

---

## Step 4: Revising and Documenting (~10 min)

### What to Show

1. Choose one operationalization based on the comparison
2. Ask the tool to document the decision:
   > "Write a methods paragraph explaining which operationalization I chose, why I chose it over the alternatives, and what limitations remain."
3. Model editing the output: "This sentence does not acknowledge the limitation honestly enough. Let me revise it."

### Key Teaching Moment

> "This documentation step is like the post-game press conference, but honest. You do not just report the score. You explain the game plan, what adjustments you made, and what you would do differently. In research, that transparency is what separates credible work from hand-waving."

## Student Experimentation (~30 min)

### Suggested Prompts to Try

1. "I am studying [your construct]. Help me define three distinct operationalizations, each with a counting rule and a limitation."
2. "Apply these three definitions to the following sample of my data. Show me where they disagree."
3. "Compare the results across all three definitions. Which one is most defensible for my research question?"
4. "Write a methods paragraph documenting my operationalization choice and its limitations."

### Instructor Role During Experimentation

- Rotate through groups, spending 3-4 minutes with each
- Ask: "Which definition did you choose? Why? What did you reject?"
- Push: "Can you defend this to a reviewer who disagrees?"
- Reinforce: "The tool counted for you. The choice is yours."
