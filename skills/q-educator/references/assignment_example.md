## Instructions

Complete each section below as a group. This document should demonstrate that your team has a clear, defensible plan for the project. The instructor will provide feedback during the following class to help you refine your approach before the work session begins.

This is a planning document, not a final report. Expectations are for reasonable preliminary thinking, not polished answers.

## 1. Research Questions and Significance

For each research question, address all three components below. The goal is to show the logical connection between the phenomenon you are investigating, the question you are asking, and why it matters.

**The Question:**
State your research question clearly and specifically.

**The Context:**
What phenomenon, debate, or gap does this question address? Connect to current events, public discourse, or real-world observations, and to relevant theoretical perspectives from any discipline. Justify why your chosen framework is appropriate.

**Why It Matters:**
Who cares about this question? Why now? What is at stake for stakeholders?

## 2. Dataset Selection and Justification

**Dataset Choice:** Identify which dataset you are using.

**Justification:** Explain why this dataset is appropriate for your research question.

**Key files you plan to use:** List specific data files.

## 3. Preliminary Variable Operationalization

For your main constructs, describe how you will measure or identify them in the data.

| Construct                     | Operational Definition                                            | Data Source / Indicator                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [e.g., Skill-based discourse] | [e.g., Comments mentioning athletic performance, stats, gameplay] | [e.g., Keyword search in comment data] |
|                               |                                                                   |                                        |

## 4. Proposed Analyses

Outline the analytical approaches you plan to use. For each, explain how it addresses your research question.

| Analysis Type                      | Description                                             | RQ Addressed |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [e.g., Keyword frequency analysis] | [e.g., Count occurrences of skill vs. appearance terms] | [RQ 1]       |
|                                    |                                                         |              |

## 5. Limitations and Potential Issues

Identify at least 2-3 limitations or challenges with your approach. Be honest. Acknowledging limits is a strength, not a weakness.

1. [Limitation 1]
2. [Limitation 2]
3. [Limitation 3]

---

## 6. Ethical Considerations

Address the following:

**Privacy:** Are you analyzing public or private data? Are there risks of identifying individuals?

**Harm:** Could your analysis reinforce stereotypes or cause harm to groups discussed?

**Bias:** What biases might exist in your data or your interpretation?

---

## 7. Group Role Assignments

Specify who is responsible for what. Titles are flexible, but responsibilities must be clear.

| Role         | Group Member | Primary Responsibilities                                      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Lead    | [Name]       | [e.g., Data cleaning, preprocessing, file management]         |
| Methods Lead | [Name]       | [e.g., Analysis design, tool implementation, documentation]   |
| Theory Lead  | [Name]       | [e.g., Literature integration, RQ refinement, interpretation] |

---

## 8. Data Visualization Plan

Create at least one data visualization that addresses your research question.

**Primary Goal:** What story does your visualization tell? What specific question does it answer?

**Visualization Description:** Describe the type of chart or graph you are creating and what it will show.

**Design Rationale:** Why did you choose this visualization type? How does it clarify your argument?

**Verification Methods:**
- [ ] Spot-checked calculations against source data
- [ ] Had groupmate review for accuracy
- [ ] Verified percentages and totals add up correctly

**Brief Interpretation (2-3 sentences):** What does this visualization show? What pattern or insight does it reveal?

---

## 9. AI-Assisted Work Documentation

If you used AI tools for any part of this plan, document your process and verification methods.

**Tools Used:** Which AI tools or IDEs did you use, and for what purpose?

**Verification Methods:**

Code Explanation:
- [ ] I asked AI to explain what each section of code does
- [ ] I reviewed explanations and understand the logic

Output Validation:
- [ ] I cross-checked AI calculations against manual spot-checks (specify number of checks)
- [ ] I verified outputs make logical sense given my data

Iterative Refinement:
- Number of prompt iterations before getting usable output: ___
- Key refinements made: [describe]

**Learning Reflection:** What did you learn from working with AI on this project? What did examining the AI-generated output teach you?
