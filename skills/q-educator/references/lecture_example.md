# Week N Lecture Outline: Operationalization Revisited
**[Course Code] | [Date]**

---

## Pre-Class Note

> Students returned from break last week. The previous session introduced the full project pipeline. Several groups struggled with translating abstract concepts into measurable constructs during their project plans. This session slows down and focuses specifically on operationalization as a skill, using domain-specific examples to ground the concept before students return to their own data.

## Part 1: The Gap Between "I Know What I Mean" and "I Can Measure It" (~15 min)

### The Locker Room Whiteboard

> "Every coach has had this moment. You walk into the film room and say, 'We need to play tougher defense.' Everyone nods. But when you break it down: does tougher mean more contested shots? Lower opponent shooting percentage? More charges taken? More deflections? The word 'tougher' means something different to every player in that room until you operationalize it."

> "Research works the same way. You say 'representation.' You say 'legitimacy.' You say 'toxicity.' Everyone nods. But until you define exactly what you are counting, measuring, or classifying, you do not have a construct. You have a feeling."

### The Translation Table

| Abstract Concept     | Possible Operationalization A                     | Possible Operationalization B                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Tougher defense"    | Opponent field goal % in the paint below 42%      | More than 8 charges drawn per game                      |
| "Toxic discourse"    | Comments containing profanity or personal attacks | Comments receiving negative sentiment scores below -0.5 |
| "Athlete visibility" | Number of posts featuring the athlete per week    | Total engagement (likes + comments) per athlete post    |

> "Notice that each concept has multiple defensible operationalizations. There is no single correct answer. The question is whether your choice is justified and whether you can explain why you chose it over alternatives."

Key Insight:
> "Operationalization is where your scholarly judgment matters most. The tool can count anything. You decide what is worth counting."

### Q&A Pause (~3 min)
- "Think about your project construct. How did you operationalize it? Could you defend that choice to a skeptic?"

## Part 2: Common Operationalization Pitfalls (~10 min)

### The Scouting Report That Misses the Point

> "Imagine your scouting report says the opposing point guard averages 18 points per game. Sounds dangerous. But what if 15 of those points come in garbage time when the game is already decided? The number is accurate. The operationalization is misleading. You measured the right thing in the wrong context."

> "Same thing happens in research. You count the frequency of a keyword, but you do not account for sarcasm. You measure engagement, but you do not distinguish between supportive comments and hate clicks. The number looks clean. The construct is contaminated."

### Three Pitfalls

| Pitfall                                        | Example                                                                            | How to Catch It                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Measuring the right thing in the wrong context | Counting all mentions of a keyword without distinguishing discussion from derision | Read a sample of flagged cases manually   |
| Conflating frequency with intensity            | Treating one comment with 500 words the same as one comment with 3 words           | Weight by length or analyze separately    |
| Letting the tool define the construct          | Accepting a sentiment score without asking what the model considers "positive"     | Test edge cases against your own judgment |

Key Insight:
> "If you cannot explain what your measure captures and what it misses, you have not finished operationalizing."

### Q&A Pause (~3 min)
- "Has anyone encountered a situation where the AI gave you a number that looked right but felt wrong? What did you do?"

## Demo Preview (~5 min)

> "I am going to walk through an operationalization exercise live using your project data. We will take one abstract concept, generate three different operationalizations, test each one on a sample of the data, and see how the results change depending on which definition we use. Watch for where I make judgment calls and where the tool just follows instructions."
